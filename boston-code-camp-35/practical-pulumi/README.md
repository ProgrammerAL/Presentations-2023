# Practical Pulumi

## Abstract

Pulumi lets your manage your cloud infrastructure with code. And like all code, it's good to know the features available to you, and to know when you should or shouldn't use them. We'll review some advanced features of Pulumi, and look at certain patterns that emerge in your code as you create larger Pulumi based projects. This is an intermediate session assuming you know the basics of Pulumi, but maybe haven't used it for a full project yet.
